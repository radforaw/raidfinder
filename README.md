##What this does.....

- Find's out which games I'm currently streaming

- Goes and gets the list of all the people streaming the game.

- Finds the 5 with closest number of viewers to me

- Gets the recent 'stream picture' from them

- Gets the channel description, stream description, username etc

- Finds out how long they have been streaming (in this stream) and sorts by the shortest

- Then it saves that data in files that are picked up by OBS in a pre-rendered scene (by using text and image sources)

done

can anyone remember how to do markdown?
